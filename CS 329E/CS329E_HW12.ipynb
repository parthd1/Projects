Here is a nice [tutorial](https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/). You can get the list of lists of transactions by grouping the data by \"Transaction\" column, referencing the \"Item\" column, then applying a list.  This gives you a series with the transaction ID equal to the index, but the [TransactionEncoder](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/preprocessing/TransactionEncoder/) to prep the data for our library just wants the values of that series. \n","\n","There are other methods you may use to create the transaction array using the `BreadBasked.csv` data with the `NONE` values filtered out, but they might require a little more code than the methodology suggested above.\n","\n","Use the `mlxtend` TransactionEncoder library to encode the transaction array in a one hot encoding. Create the one hot encoding using the TransactionEncoder, and check it was done properly by looking at the first 4 transactions using the `inverse_transform`. Finish off the data prep for the frequent itemset generation by converting the transactions back to a dataframe using the [documentation](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/apriori/) as a reference.
