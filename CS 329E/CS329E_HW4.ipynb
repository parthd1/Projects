They reach a minimum at a depth of 3 for entropy and 2 for gini, then slowly increase afterwards, indicating that the trees are being overfitted. We can confirm this by looking at the training errors and noting that they monotonically decrease as depth increases. At high depths, the model is almost perfect for predicting the training set, but is noticeably worse at predicting the test set. On a different note, entropy is a better impurity measure for this data because it produces lower errors more often."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8CevWP5L0D__"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
